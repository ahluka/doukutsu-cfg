doukutsu-cfg
============

Simple utility for working with the Cave Story config file, Config.dat.

If it makes a difference, I've only tested this against the Cave Story linux port by Simon Parzer and Peter Mackay,
which can be found [here](http://cavestory.org/download/cave-story.php).

As of today (16 Nov 2019) it only dumps the config. Modifying is planned, and is easy to add even if I don't get around to it myself.
